This Android application was developed for the 2013 Future Business Leader's of America (FBLA) Mobile Application Development competition. The app mainly does one thing, allow farmville-like requests to the user's friends on Facebook with a premade message relating to assistance needed in technology. This app works well if you have the Facebook app also installed, and you must have a Facebook account to be able to use the app. It is available in English, Spanish (translated by me), and Polish (translated by Karmen Nejranowska). This app also shows some information of the developers in the About page. The partnership name was called OPAL Technologies after the last names of each of the partners: Owens, Proctor, And Lopez.

The development of this app involved many sleepless nights during the December of 2013. It was not exactly the fun project I imagined it to be at the beginning. This is due to a multi-faceted problem, first being the specifications themselves. While they look very comprehensive they are as definite as a plasma, providing no concrete substance to which to plan an app on. Also they required the use of some social network which we picked Facebook. Facebook's API for Android apps is horribly documented, which lead to crazy development times such as 2 weeks it took to integrate the "login to facebook" button. Combine this on top of other class work and then you have yourself a developer's nightmare which was my reality.
